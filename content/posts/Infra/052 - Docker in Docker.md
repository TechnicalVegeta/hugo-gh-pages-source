### Background üìÉ

First let's understand the use cases to run docker inside a docker container.

Generally we build docker images in a VM which is a common approch. but recently,
I was trying to create a Docker-based dynamic container as agent for the TeamCity Server,
As a part of CI build, the pipeline will create a docker image inside the docker agent which i have integrated with the TeamCity Server.

### Requirement

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To full fill this requirement, the docker based agent should have a docker functionality in it.  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è There are three ways to achive it based on our environemt requirements.  

### Methods which i explored

#### Method 1 - Using docker.sock
![docker.sock](/052_Docker/docker.sock.png)

**What is docker.sock ?**  
``` /var/run/docker.sock ``` is the UNIX socket that Docker daemon is listening to. It's the main entry point for Docker API. It also can be TCP socket but by default for security reasons Docker defaults to use UNIX socket. Docker cli client uses this socket to execute docker commands by default. If you are on the same host where Docker daemon is running, you can use the /var/run/docker.sock to manage containers.  

Now to use docker functionality inside docker container, all you are have do is just run the docker container by mounting the ``` docker.sock ``` path as a volume inside the container.  

**Example**
```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti <Imange-Name>
```

**Risk Factor**

This approch increases attack surface so you should be careful if you mount docker socket inside a container there are trusted codes running inside that container otherwise you can simply compromise your host that is running docker daemon, since Docker by default launches all containers as root.  

#### Method 2 - Using Docker image with dind
![DinD](/052_Docker/DinD.png)
**What is DinD Image ?**
The official docker image with ``` dind ``` tag is know as dind Image, used to run the docker container insinside docker container. This approch is used only to create a docker like environment creating docker image and to run the docker container indside container. If only building the docker image then it is recomended to use the first.

**Requirement**  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Need official docker image with ``` dind ``` tag.  

**Example**
```bash
docker run --privileged -d --name dind-test docker:dind
```
**Risk Factor**
This approch requires that the Docker daemon container be configured as a ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù container. Running a privileged container reduces isolation between the container and the underlying host and creates security risks, because the init process inside the container runs with the same privileges as the root user on the host.
It may be a viable (though risky) solution in trusted environments, but it‚Äôs not a viable solution in environments where you don‚Äôt trust the workloads running inside the DinD container. For this reason, use of DinD is generally not recommended by Docker (even though it‚Äôs officially supported).

#### Method 3 - Using Sysbox
![Sysbox](/052_Docker/Sysbox.png)
In the above two methods we can see the same kind of drawbacks, where we cannot use these approches in production environments because this significantly weakens isolation between the container and the underlying host, posing a strong security risk, but Sysbox is software that installs on the Linux host machine, integrates with Docker and run as System Container.

**What is Sysbox ?**
Sysbox is a open-source container runtime  ("runc") developed by Nestybox, which is now aquired by Docker Inc. Within a Nestybox system container you are able to run Docker inside the container easily and securely, with total isolation between the Docker inside the system container and the Docker on the host. No need for privileged containers anymore.
