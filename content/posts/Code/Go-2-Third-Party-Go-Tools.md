### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Background

While some people choose to distribute their Go programs as pre-compiled binaries,
tools written in Go can also be built from source and installed into your Go work‚Äêspace via the go install command.

Go‚Äôs method for publishing code is a bit different than most other languages. Go
developers don‚Äôt rely on a centrally hosted service, like Maven Central for Java or the
NPM registry for JavaScript. Instead, they share projects via their source code repositories.
The go install command takes an argument, which is the location of the
source code repository of the project you want to install, followed by an @ and the
version of the tool you want (if you just want to get the latest version, use @latest)
then downloads, compiles, and installs the tool into your $GOPATH/bin directory.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Few examples of useful Tools

**1. Hey for HTTP Response-** There‚Äôs a great Go tool called hey that load tests HTTP servers. You can point it at the website url of your choice or an application that you‚Äôve
written.
Here‚Äôs how to install hey with the go install command:

```go
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

*Note:* If you have already installed the tool and want to update it to newer version. rerun the go install command with @latest

*output:*  
go: downloading github.com/rakyll/hey v0.1.4  
go: downloading golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20181017193950-04a2e542c03f  
go: downloading golang.org/x/text v0.3.0  

This downloads hey and all of its dependencies, builds the program, and installs the binary in your $GOPATH/bin directory.  

We have built and installed hey, Now its time to run:  

```go
hey https://blogs.decodegeek.co.in
```

*Output:*

**2. Formatting your code (fmt vs goimports) -** One of the main design goals for Go was to create a language that allowed you to
write code efficiently. This meant having simple syntax and a fast compiler. Most of us have wasted most of out time on formatting codes in other languages.
Since Go defines a standard way of formatting code, Go developers avoid arguments over One True Brace Style and Tabs vs. Spaces,
For example, Go programs use tabs to indent.  
**Go fmt** - The Go development tools include a command - *go fmt*, which automatically reformats your code to match the standard format. It does things like fixing up the white‚Äê
space for indentation, lining up the fields in a struct, and making sure there is proper spacing around operators.  
**Goimports** - There is an enhanced version of go fmt available called goimports that also cleans up your import statements. It puts them in alphabetical order, removes unused imports,
and attempts to guess any unspecified imports. Its guesses are sometimes inaccurate, so you should insert imports yourself.  
*download goimports:*

```go
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

*To run goimports accross project:*

```go
goimports -l -w .
```

*Note:* The -l flag tells goimports to print the files with incorrect formatting to the console. The -w flag tells goimports to modify the files in-place. The . specifies the files to be scanned: everything in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.  

if any unwanted declarations have been made in the code, then we receive similar to below.  
*Output:*

```output
err:
hello.go:62:1: expected declaration, found hj
```

**3. Linting and Venting -**
While go fmt ensures your code is formatted correctly, it‚Äôs just the first step in ensuring that your code is idiomatic and of high quality.
There are tools that help to enforce this style. The first is called *golint*.  
**Golint** - Some of the changes it suggests include properly naming variables, formatting error messages, and placing comments
on public methods and types. These aren‚Äôt errors; they don‚Äôt keep your programs from compiling or make your program run incorrectly.
at the time of writing this post, i found that the golint tool is depricated and currently there is no drop-in replacement available.  
*[Go lint package link](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/lint#section-readme) and screenshot for more reference.*
![screenshot ](/Go_002/Go_linter.png)

As you can see above screenshot, the *go vet* is another tool, which may not be the exact replacement of the golint.  

**Go vet** - The code is syntactically valid, but there are mistakes that are not what you meant to do. This includes things
like passing the wrong number of parameters to formatting methods or assigning values to variables that are never used. The go tool includes a command called *go vet* to
detect these kinds of errors. There is no need to install *go vet*, it exist by default.

```go
// To run go vet to entier project
go vet ./...

```

*Output:*
To produce error for this example i have just defined "var a = strings.Builder" in main.go file but not used, so it produces the error as below.

```output
vet.exe: .\hello.go:11:9: strings.Builder (type) is not an expression
```

*Note:* There are additional third-party tools to check code style and scan for potential bugs. However, running multiple tools over your code slows down the build because each
tool spends time scanning the source code for itself.  

Rather than use separate tools, you can run multiple tools together with *golangci-lint.*  

**golangci-lint** -
It combines golint, go vet, and an ever-increasing set of other code quality tools. Once it is installed, you run golangci-lint with the command:

```go
golangci-lint run
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

Make go vet or golangci-lint part of your development process to avoid common bugs and nonidiomatic code.  

*Note:* I recommend you to start with go vet and include golangci-lint, because golangci-lint runs 10 different linters by default, so it‚Äôs inevitable that your team may disagree with some of its suggestions.
you can configure which linters are enabled and which files they analyze by including a file named *.golangci.yml* at the root of your project. Check out the [documentation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/) for the file format.

Hope these tips help you out in writing more efficient Go, I will post my next topic on how to automate the build for Go including all these tools in the build. üòá
